# The problem


A plate with dimensions X and Y are defined by the user in ["Geometry"]["Length X"]["Length Y"]

The plate, made of orthotropic, material is heated on the left boundary with a constant heat Q, defined by the user in ["Boundary Conditions"]["Power"]. We assumed that this material is aluminium"

The plate's initial temperature is defined by the user in ["Materials"]["Aluminium"]["Initial Temperature"]. Other material properties are also defined in ["Materials"]["Aluminium"].

The plate is inside a room, with a constant temperature is set by the user in ["Boundary Conditions"]["Room Temperature"].

The user also define the number of elements in X and Y in ["simulation"]["Number of Elements X"] and ["simulation"]["Number of Elements Y"] respectivelly.

The number of steps and step time are defined in ["simulation"]["Step Time"] and ["simulation"]["Number Time Steps"] respectivelly. Notice that large step time may not converge and an error message will popup.

Finally, the code generates Temperature plots at every interval, defined in ["Plot"]["plot interval"].

# Getting Started


### Geomtry
A class named "Geometry" is difined only to store the X and Y dimensions of the problem.
### Mesh
A class named "Plate" is defined to create the mesh and assign Initial Temperature, Thermal Diffusivity in X and Thermal Diffusivity in Y in each element.
### Model
A class named "Heat Transfer" solves the heat transfer problem by central differences.
### Plot and Animation
A class named "PlotsTwoPlates" is defined to generate figures of the thermal history in spaced intervals. In the end, a .GIF is created from those figures.
### Solver
A class named "SolvesTwoPlates" is defined to create a forward step analysis, solving the heat transfer model and plotting the figures when convenient.
